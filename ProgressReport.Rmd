Resources: Gavin Knapp has been a big help in establishing what programs needed to be used for this project and where we should go to find info and pointers.
    Brackeys is a channel on YouTube who has a lot of helpful information on how to make video games in Unity.

Goals: Use of Visual Studio Code and Unity game engine to create an education science game. This game will teach the basics of periodic table and it's organization.


Initial Results: We all downloaded Unity game engine and Visual Studio Code. We began a shared GitHub that will keep track of all of our progress. We cloned the GitHub 
repository into Visual Studio Code so we can work and save our progress through this platform. We began watching Brackeys youtube to begin learning how to create games 
in Unity.
