#Periodic Shuffle Progress Report

##General
We have created a game. The goal of this game was to make a children's game to allow them to practice thier skills of periodic table element identification.

##Jaylin Burlin
My contributions to the game included: configuring the questions and a data array used for asking questions for each of the elements, I created a function which selected random element, I updated the question text to match the element, I created a function that selected a new element after the user picked one.
